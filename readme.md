# Kite customers APN

Get the original customers file and create many registers of a same customer according the number of APNs associate to it.

For instance a customer with 1 APN will appear once in the result file, meanwhile another one with 5 APNs will appear 5 times in the result file.

Don't be lazy, take a look in the code!
